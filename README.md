# KHE Template
Basic skeleton of a KHE site, to be reskinned as needed.

To get started, clone the repo, cd into the file with `cd khe-ui-template/khe-ui-template`.

Then, run `npm install`. This only needs to be run once, to install all the stuff we're gonna use.

Then, run `npm run dev` to start development.
