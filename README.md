## Setup

Thanks for helping with KHE dev! Here's how you can get started:

``` In your terminal:

# Cloning this repo:
git clone https://github.com/hacksu/2018-kenthackenough-ui-main.git

# Going into the repo:
cd 2018-kenthackenough-ui-main

# install dependencies
# This might give you errors, depending on your machine & node version!
# Don't be afraid to ask the slack for help!
npm install

# Finally, run this command, and then go to http://localhost:8080
# to see the website in development mode!
npm run dev

# build for production with minification (don't worry about this one unless
# you know what that means)
npm run build

```
